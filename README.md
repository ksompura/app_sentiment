# Sentiment Review of 6 Different Apps
## Sentiment analysis of 6 second-hand clothing apps.

This project uses NLP methods to analyzes reviews pulled from 6 apps on the google play cloud service. The goal is to discover how people feel about these different apps over time so that a new app entering the industry or an existing company can implement well liked practices and avoid critical issues that cause disapproval.

This would have the effect of positively bolstering the company's reputation which has multiple downstream positive effects.

The code can easily be adapted to include more apps as well analyzing different industries.
